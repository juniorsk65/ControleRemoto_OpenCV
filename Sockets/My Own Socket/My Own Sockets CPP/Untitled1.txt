The system calls for establishing a connection are somewhat different for the client and the server, but both involve the basic construct of a socket.
A socket is one end of an interprocess communication channel. The two processes
each establish their own socket.

The steps involved in establishing a socket on the client side are as follows:

    Create a socket with the socket() system call
    Connect the socket to the address of the server using the connect() system call
    Send and receive data. There are a number of ways to do this, but the simplest is to use the read() and write() system calls.

The steps involved in establishing a socket on the server side are as follows:

    Create a socket with the socket() system call
    Bind the socket to an address using the bind() system call. For a server socket on the Internet, an address consists of a port number on the host machine.
    Listen for connections with the listen() system call
    Accept a connection with the accept() system call. This call typically blocks until a client connects with the server.
    Send and receive data
